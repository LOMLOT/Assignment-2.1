the old .rar contains the files that I started working with. thr .js doesn't work so there is no logic.


The new .rar works as I intended with the .js actually prefoming well. it is a long string of if else if else barf, I will make sure to correct that by utilizing loop functions once I mess around with them more


To be honest it was difficult to try and make what feels like a faux cpu vs cpu rock paper scissors game with the limited fragments of the .js code I saw from the july 31 meeting 
but Im proud that I managed to figure it out in the end.

also the image folder added isnt actually used as i decided to forgo the background in effort to try and make it before the hard cutoff date. and also it looked horrible
